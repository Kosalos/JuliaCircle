# JuliaCircle
IOS  Julia Set renderer

Good beginner project to practice with Swift 4 and Metal on the iPad.
Demonstrates a Metal compute shader for rendering the Julia set to a texture, which Swift transfers to a UIImage for display.
A second compute shader adds optional shadowing and kalideoscope reflections.
